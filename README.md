During Starship SN15's scrubbed launch window, I developed a 2D simulation of its landing maneuver. After optimizing the flight dynamics model, I recreated the vehicle's signature "belly flop" to a vertical landing sequence.

Compared to actual SpaceX footage, the simulation showed remarkable accuracy - despite being developed purely from first principles without reference to empirical data.
